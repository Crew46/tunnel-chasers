| systems         | Table    |                                 | Used internally by the engine to track systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| get_system      | Function |                                 | Used internally by the engine to load systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| make_system     | Function |                                 | This function should be used to register any systems. It takes three arguments. The first is the String id of the system you are adding. The second is a reference to a function, which will be called upon first load of that system. The third is a function that will be called every tick until the system finishes. |
| current_system  | String   | "menu", "credits", "charselect" | This variable is used to switch between systems and indicate to the engine that your system is done. Simply set the variable to the String id of the next system to load.                                                                                                                                                |
| previous_system | String   |                                 | Used internally by the engine to track when the system changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
